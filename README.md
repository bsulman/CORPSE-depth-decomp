# CORPSE-depth-decomp

Simulations of soil carbon decomposition with depth from Hicks Pries, Sulman, et al. (2018). “Root Litter Decomposition Slows with Soil Depth.” Soil Biology & Biochemistry 125 (October): 103–14. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.07.002.

Model is defined in CORPSE.py and simulations are run in depth_decomp.py. Requires numpy, matplotlib, and pandas packages.
